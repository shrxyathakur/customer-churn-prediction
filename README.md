## 🧠 Overview
This project predicts **telecom customer churn** using **Machine Learning models** built in **Dataiku**.  
It combines **K-Means Clustering** for segmentation and **Random Forest** for churn prediction, helping identify at-risk customers and reduce revenue loss.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior to detect churn patterns.  
- Clean and prepare data for modeling.  
- Segment customers using **K-Means**.  
- Predict churn probability using **Random Forest**.  
- Visualize key insights through **Dataiku Dashboards**.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech
- **Platform:** Dataiku  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn  
- **Dataset:** [Telecom Churn – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets)

---

## 🧩 Methodology
1. Import and clean telecom churn data.  
2. Perform EDA to find churn patterns.  
3. Cluster customers with **K-Means**.  
4. Train **Random Forest** to predict churn.  
5. Evaluate accuracy and interpret key drivers.  

---

## 📈 Results
- Combined clustering + classification improved accuracy.  
- Major churn indicators:
  - High customer service calls  
  - Short contract duration  
  - High total minutes used  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open project in **Dataiku DSS**.  
2. Import the dataset (from Kaggle).  
3. Run the **data preparation flow**.  
4. Execute **K-Means** and **Random Forest** recipes.  
5. View dashboards for churn insights.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
Accurately predicting churn enables telecom companies to design better **retention strategies** and improve customer satisfaction through **data-driven decisions**.
